    <h1>HISTORY - ISEP</h1>

    <div class="article">
        <section id="History">
            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>
                The Story begins in 2027 when a group of astronomists, scientists, and more under the work of Gramhston
                start a new Space Agency called GSEP (Gramhston’s Space Exploration Program). Their agency was ambitious
                and very one of its kind. They made a lot of progress in their time.
                They reached the skies in 2030, just 3 years after their formation. They were highly ambitious and aimed
                to get humans into the universe upto 2200s. a lot of critics blow up on them, but they never stopped
                progress of their Agency. The company got a lot of fundings from people who trusted them. The IAO
                (International Astronomic Organization) recognized GSEP as a progressing space agency in the world.
                Year by year, the GSEP kept progressing. The company was doing really good. And they made their first
                mission to moon in 2037 only. Watching this, The French government (Gramhston’s native country) gave him
                the position of Administrator in CNES, which is the Space Agency of France. With this, Gramshton got
                resources along with government support. His leadership was what took us from digging on land to living
                in mars.
                The first ever mission to mars was done in 2054 after rise of tensions in the world and a failed mars
                mission where 2 astronouts died. This mission went successful and showed us our future home, MARS.
                Everything was going well until something that would change the entire world.</p>

        <div id="WinterWar">
            <h2>The Great Winter War</h2>
            <p>

                It was the time of 2056 when Communism’s 2nd Rise began as inequality and exploitation of resources were
                at its peak in Middle Africa and due to this, a lot of communist groups started revolting in Africa.
                They all were isolated from each other but had only one single motif
                “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity”
                “Bread, Peace, Land”
                Their needs were valid but their approach wasn’t, they followed voilence, noble’s exploitation and
                threatining Democracy. They successfully took over, but this was just the starting. The US, who
                supported capitalism and freedom, started deploying armies with support of other countries attacked
                majority of those countries. But China, as a communist nation, backfired US with a bang of attack over
                US supporting countries.
                The war was that horrible that in 2063, half the world was just fighting against each other, while those
                countries who started those were like chilling in their mainland seeing their enemy’s allies being
                destroyed.
                A few countries had managed to maintain their position as a neutral, one of them was France, where CNES,
                under Gramshton kept doing more reforms in the agency. Along with the wars, the 2nd Space race had also
                started.
                Year by year, both the sides started weakening and all the countries which were pushed into the wars
                started going against their own side and some joined the NAN in order to be safe from the chaos.
                The war ended in 2083 when US, China and any other major powers in the world came to an edge of
                collapse. The countries that stayed neutral for most the times were developing and majority of the
                countries participating in the war faced economic, political and humanity crises.

            <h2>
                The Rise of ISEP</h2>
            <p>
                While Great Winter war was happening, Gramshton passed away in 2071. Even though his term ended in 2040,
                his mind,
                plans, and everything became a blueprint for humans to reach the skies.
                Due to this big success, a lot of space startups started rising and collaborating to make an
                International Union of
                Space Agencies which were called ISEP (International Space Exploration Program). The NASA and China’s
                Space agency
                also came in it because their governments failed to give any more resources to them.
                After several mars missions done by ISEP, they decided to do something humans wanted for years. They
                started
                terrafarming Mars into a habitable planet such that humans can go and live there as their new home.</p>

        <div id="Mars">
            <h2>Mars Terraforming</h2>
            <p>
                The process of terraforming mars began with invention of Habitat zones which helped people to live
                freely in the
                harsh enviornments of mars. This began in 2088 where 10 missions were launched to send habitat zones
                with temporary
                human settlements to mars.
                And then ISEP did one thing that at first seemed stupid but was a genius step. They built power plants
                powered by
                non-renewable sources, these plants got the resources from the soil of mars and used it to generate
                Carbon dioxide
                which slowly heated the mars and decreased it to 25* C upto 2090.
                A lot of Ammonia rich asteroids were mined in order to make mar’s soil Nitrogen rich, and at last water
                was added
                along with some photoplanktons to get Oxygen.
                This entire process is currently being carried out by ISEP, and they estimate the Mars to be terraformed
                in several
                years. But This process isn’t so quick as mentioned in books, Humans are currently able to live there in
                habitat
                zones but it will take an entire century to get Mars warmth and watered. Nitrogen and Oxygen would take
                an entire
                milennium to get.</p>
